			Designing a Class

Coherence
------------------------
A class should describe a single entity

All the class operations should logically fit together to support a coherent purpose

You should not combine students and staff in the same class, 
because students and staff have different entities


Separating responsibilities
-----------------------------------------
Too many responsibilities can be broken into several classes to separate responsibilities

Example classes deal with strings:  String, StringBuilder, and StringBuffer


Reuse
---------------
Classes are designed for reuse. 

No restrictions on what or when the user can do with it


Standard
----------------
Provide a public no-arg constructor 

Override the equals() method and the toString() method

Follow standard Java programming style and naming conventions

Using Visibility Modifiers; private, public, protected

Private modifier to hide its data from direct access by clients

Getter/Setter

A property that is shared by all the instances of the class should be declared as a static
